Fish Tracker v. 9.0

1.  delete's the gray-scale mask 
2.  makes the mask in the capture view semi-transparent.

Goal for this version:  get everything to work when the app starts up with the device in
landscape mode.  Is the problem that I get the dimensions before the app switches to 
portrate mode?

Goal 2:  when setting rows & cols sometimes offsets the resulting mask.  Why?
